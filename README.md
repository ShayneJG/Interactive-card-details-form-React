# Interactive-card-details-form-React


Developed and published by Shayne Geilman, using designs from frontendmentor.com.




This project utilizes React and Tailwind. 


The website is responsive (there is some mild issues at very specific sizes). Following the rules set out by front-end mentor, there is error handling on the form inputs that tell the user if they have input the wrong information (e.g., inputs have been left blank, or letters are used instead of numbers). 
The designs specify that they are for 1440p and 375p, so the desktop and mobile versions have been modelled around those, respectively.
